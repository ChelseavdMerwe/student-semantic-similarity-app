# üéØ AI Workshop Demo Plan (1 Hour)

## Your Setup (4 Days to Prepare)
- ‚úÖ App is ready!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to add API key to code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to host on Streamlit Cloud (free)

## Workshop Flow (60 minutes)

### Phase 1: Introduction (5 mins)
**You say:** "Today we're going to use AI to find connections between all of you! First, everyone will create a profile..."

### Phase 2: Profile Creation (10 mins)
- Students enter:
  - Name
  - Hobbies
  - Music preference
  - Fun fact
- **They CAN'T upload images yet** (this is the key!)

### Phase 3: First Network View (5 mins)
**Show the graph** based on just their profiles
- Point out connections based on hobbies, music
- **Teaching moment:** "This is rule-based matching - just comparing what you said"

### Phase 4: THE FUN PART - Image Hunt (20 mins)
**You say:** "Now for the AI part! Run around the office and take/find 3-5 photos that represent YOU:"
- Photos of things they like
- Their style
- What makes them unique

Students run around taking photos with phones!

### Phase 5: AI Analysis (15 mins)
- Students upload their images
- **AI analyzes in real-time**
- Show what AI "sees" in each image
- Graph UPDATES with new connections!

### Phase 6: The Big Reveal (5 mins)
**Teaching moments:**
1. "Look how the connections changed!"
2. "The AI found similarities you didn't explicitly say"
3. "This is how recommendation systems work (Netflix, Spotify, TikTok)"
4. Show specific examples where AI connected two students

## Key Improvements Needed for Your App

###  1. Make it CLEARER what connections mean
Add explanation box at top of graph

### 2. Show BEFORE/AFTER comparison
Maybe save a screenshot of the network before images

### 3. Highlight AI discoveries
Show which connections were AI-driven vs. manual

### 4. Make it more visual/colorful
Teens respond to visual appeal!

## Workshop Success Tips
1. **Have backup images ready** in case students are shy
2. **Make it competitive** - "Who can find the most interesting photos?"
3. **Explain AI limitations** - sometimes it gets things wrong!
4. **Privacy moment** - explain images stay in memory only

## Budget
- Hosting: FREE (Streamlit Cloud)
- AI analysis: ~$0.20-0.50 for 15-20 students (covered by OpenAI's $5 free credit)
- Total cost: **$0**

Would you like me to implement these improvements to make the demo more impactful?
